  new Plant("Salal (Gaultheria shallon)", "Salal is a mid-sized, woody shrub with thick, leathery leaves. Berries are arranged along an elongated “branch” that is sticky to the touch. In the late summer, the berries mature. Mature berries are dark purple, almost black, and slightly sticky. The berries taste like a cross between blueberries and blackcurrants. Salal also has other uses– for example, the leaves can be chewed as a hunger suppressant, and can also be curled into a cone for sipping water from!"),
  new Plant("Himalayan Blackberry (Rubus armeniacus)", "This plant grows as a woody vine that clumps together in dense thickets. The leaves are often grouped in pairs of five, with toothed margins. The sweet, black berries are arranged haphazardly around the plant. Watch out for the thorns present along the length of the branches. This should be a familiar plant, as it is found along nearly every trail, highway, and bare spot of ground in Washington!"),
  new Plant("Red Huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium)", "The red huckleberry is a deciduous shrub with small, flat, oval-shaped leaves and thin stems. The berries are small and round, and when they ripen in the summer, their berries are bright red. They taste mildly acidic, with some comparing the taste to a tart blueberry. \nWARNING: Ensure that the leaves are broad and flat, not needle-like. Similar plants with needle-like leaves are actually yew, and the berries of yew are poisonous to humans. Yew berries also have square indentations at the apex of the berries– if your berries have this indicator, DO NOT consume them. "),
  new Plant("Salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis)", "The salmonberry is delightful for the birds, and some humans find them equally delicious. The salmonberry is a prickly shrub, often growing in wet sites such as near streams or at the base of hills. The leaves resemble that of raspberry or blackberry leaves, with roughly 3 to five leaflets for each leaf unit, each having serrated or “toothed” edges. The bark of the salmonberry sometimes peels off, and the prickles can often be easily removed by rubbing a stick against the salmonberry stem. The berries ripen in late spring to early summer, and when ripe they are bright yellow, orange, or red berries that are similar in appearance to blackberries. Many compare the taste of the fruits to that of raspberries. "),
  new Plant("Thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus)", "The thimbleberry bears deep red, tart and honey-flavored fruit in late spring and early autumn, which are particularly attractive to birds in this area. The thimbleberry plant is a shrub, but unlike its siblings in the Rubus genus, it bears no thorns along its stem (great news for hikers!). The leaves are shaped somewhat like stars, and they are covered in small hairs that make them feel fuzzy when you pet them. For those of you wanting to pick for a large number of people, or to pick a lot of these berries to use in jams or the like, know that they ripen from light pink to red when kept in storage for 1-3 days, so you can pick them slightly prematurely and they’ll be ripe by the time you use them!"),
